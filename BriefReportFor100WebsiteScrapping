### 4. Brief Report

#### Approach

1. **Data Extraction**:
   - Used `requests` to fetch the HTML content of each URL.
   - Used `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML and extract the meta title, meta description, and social media links.
   - Identified the tech stack by searching for specific keywords in the HTML content.
   - Detected payment gateways by checking for known keywords in the HTML content.
   - Extracted the website language from the `<html>` tag.
   - Categorized the website based on the URL and predefined keywords.
   - Retrieved WHOIS information using the `whois` library.

2. **Database Storage**:
   - Connected to a MySQL database using `pymysql`.
   - Inserted the extracted data into the `website_data` table.

#### Challenges

1. **Dynamic Content**:
   - Some websites may load content dynamically using JavaScript, which `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` cannot handle. This may lead to incomplete data extraction.
   - Solution: For such cases, a more advanced tool like Selenium could be used to render JavaScript.

2. **Rate Limiting and Captchas**:
   - Some websites may have rate limiting or captchas to prevent automated scraping.
   - Solution: Implementing delays between requests and using proxies can help mitigate this issue.

3. **WHOIS Information**:
   - WHOIS information may not always be available or may be protected by privacy services.
   - Solution: Handle exceptions and log errors appropriately.

4. **Data Consistency**:
   - Ensuring consistent and accurate extraction of information across various websites with different structures.
   - Solution: Regularly update the scraping logic and test against a diverse set of URLs.

5. **Security Concerns**:
   - Handling sensitive information such as database credentials securely.
   - Solution: Use environment variables or configuration files to store sensitive information securely.

Overall, the project successfully demonstrates the ability to scrape and store information from various websites, though some limitations exist that could be addressed with more advanced techniques and tools.
